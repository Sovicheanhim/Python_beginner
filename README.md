# Python_beginner_exercises_for_practices
The repository contains some python exercises and projects that are beginner-friendly. Each exercise or project is made freely available for everyone to participate in coding. Have fun!!!

One more thing, these exercises are what I've from my Python bootcamp so some codes are really bad-written but it manages to run and work somehow. But still, maybe in the future, I'll make an update on these codes so that it'll be more efficient and understandable. And since I understand the struggle begginner-coder like me to read the entire code for trying to understand it. Maybe each exercises is written with its algorithm and hints to help you understand more about the exercises or even write your own codes instead of looking at my scrambling codes.
